^^ I used this video to learn how to set and get items in local storage in react.

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all requirements for this task as well as a couple of stretch goals. These included adding local storage saving to the game, using the Upgrades API to manage upgrades, a hamburger menu and also media queries so the app is usable on desktop and mobile.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I would have liked to have added background music with controls as well as adding functionality to my upgrades section in the hamburger menu. I would also have liked to create a tailored API for the donut theming of my project.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I had some issues with figuring out how to display individual values for how many of each upgrade had been bought. I didn't quite make it to the other stretch goals I'd set myself due to time constraints.

Overall I felt that the project went quite well, and sams catch up lessons towards the end of the week were a lot of help when trying to set out a plan for how to create the project.
